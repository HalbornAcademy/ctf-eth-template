# --------------------------
# RPC & BLOCK_NUMBER:
# --------------------------
# It is used to fork from a testnet/mainnet RPC url from an specific BLOCK_NUMBER
#
# --------------------------
# FLAGS:
# --------------------------
# You can specify custom flags for the "anvil" node, such as setting the default balance
# or disabling mining with `--no-mining`, etc
#
#     > These flags will affect only the player node instance
#
# --------------------------
# MNEMONIC
# --------------------------
# The mnemonic used to generate the player accounts, if not specified it is randomly generated
#
# --------------------------
# RUNNABLES:
# --------------------------
# You can create custom functions that can be executed every x seconds,
# they take 3 arguments, the state, deployer and player accounts.
#
#        def check_for_low_balance(state, deployer, player):
#            state['low_balance'] = False
#            if player[0].balance < web3.toWei(1, 'ether'):
#                state['low_balance'] = True
# On the CONFIG file you can add runnables by storing a tuple of (function, seconds):
#      'RUNNABLES': [(check_for_low_balance, 10)],
#
# This will add the check_for_low_balance function to be executed every 10 seconds
#
# More Examples:
# For example when mining is disabled you could check for pending
# mempool txs and act on it modifying the "state" and reporting that the challenge
# is solved under "solved"
#
# --------------------------
# RESTRICTED_RPC_METHODS
# --------------------------
#
# Does allow to specify methods that will be restricted on the player node.
# Refer to JSON RPC and https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/
# Example, restrict mining: 'RESTRICTED_RPC_METHODS': ["anvil_mine", "evm_mine"]
